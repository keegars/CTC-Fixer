MHW CTC-Fixer

An executable to automate the findings out zStatykz to update pre-iceborne CTC's to be compatible with the new format. 

To use: 

1. Download the latest release found here : https://github.com/keegars/CTC-Fixer/releases
2. Place the executable into a directory with ctcs in the current directory or sub-directories (e.g. can be placed into the MHW folder and used to update all CTC's at once)

The original CTC's will be renamed to *original*.ctc_old.old, and the updated ctc will take it's place. 

This will require .Net Framework 4.5.2. 

This is based on the following find by zStatykz https://github.com/zStatykz/MHW_CTC_Template
