CTC-Fixer

The main purpose of this executable is to amend the pre-iceborne based CTC's and to port them over to the new post-iceborne format.

You can place the executable in the directory the CTC is, or put it on the base directory of Monster Hunter World and it will search its current directory and sub-directories for any file matching "*.ctc". 

The original file will be named to *original*.ctc_old.old which will contain the original data, and the updated ctc will take it's place.

This will require .Net Framework 4.5.2 to function.
